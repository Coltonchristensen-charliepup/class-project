# what is css

-CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS
mostly involves learning the different properties you can use.
So this chapter will:
● Introduce you to how CSS works
● Teach you how to write CSS rules
● Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages
The remaining chapters in this section will look at all of the
various CSS properties you can use.

- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

-CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

-Here you can see a simple web page that is
styled using CSS.
This example uses two documents: the HTML file (example.html)
and a separate CSS file (example.css). The fifth line of HTML uses the
<link> element to indicate where the CSS file is located.
On the next page, you will see how CSS rules can also be placed in your
HTML pages and we will discuss when you might want to do this.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>Introducing CSS</title>
 <link href="css/example.css" type="text/css"
 rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

</html>
body {
font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;}
h1, h2 {

p {

-<link>
The <link> element can be used
in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS
file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does
not need a closing tag), and it
lives inside the <head> element.
It should use three attributes:
href
This specifies the path to the
CSS file (which is often placed in
a folder called css or styles).
type
This attribute specifies the type
of document being linked to. The
value should be text/css.
rel
This specifies the relationship
between the HTML page and
the file it is linked to. The value
should be stylesheet when
linking to a CSS file.

-<style>
You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the
<head> element of the page.
The <style> element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/
css.
When building a site with more
than one page, you should use
an external CSS style sheet. This:
● Allows all pages to use the
same style rules (rather than
repeating them in each page).
● Keeps the content separate
from how the page looks.
● Means you can change the
styles used across all pages
by altering just one file
(rather than each individual
page).
